# üß© Component Showcase ‚Äì Code Quality Reference

Welcome to this code sample repository. This project is **not intended to be run as a standalone application**, but rather serves as a **showcase of code structure, architecture, and quality standards** used in my previous production environment.

---

## üìå Purpose

This repository contains **selected components** extracted from a larger project. The goal is to provide a **clear example of my coding practices**, including:

- Modular component organization
- Clean, maintainable logic
- Separation of concerns between views, stores, and UI components
- A consistent design foundation based on real-world implementation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is not a functional app. Dependencies and runtime context are intentionally omitted.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/ -> Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/ -> Application state management (Pinia)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/ -> Route-level views
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ business-logic/ -> Core business logic and domain services

Each folder reflects a clear separation of responsibilities to promote **scalability** and **developer clarity**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Cashback View

The `Cashback` view is designed following our standard layout system. It utilizes a **main grid content layout** shared across all of our website pages, ensuring **visual and structural consistency** based on our **designer's UI model**.

This implementation demonstrates:

- Layout reuse and responsiveness
- View-level logic separation
- Component-driven design, true to the original design system

## ‚ú® Why This Matters

While this repository isn't executable, it‚Äôs a practical example of:

- Well-structured Vue components
- Organized state management
- UI/UX consistency guided by design specs
- Code readability and maintainability best practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Reference Only)

- Vue 3
- Pinia (for stores)
- SCSS / CSS Modules (as applicable)
- Grid-based layout system
